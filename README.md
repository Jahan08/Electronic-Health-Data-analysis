# Electronic-Health-Data-analysis
Introduction:

Synthea is an organization that focuses on making realistic health records data available to the general public/ developers in order to create technology/ awareness that will help the healthcare industry, without any legal and security boundaries.

In this Notebook I explore the Electronic Health Record (EHR) data from Synthea.

Here, we will perform the following operations:

1. summarize the content of the dataset
2. explore one file, to understand the data structure
3. reformat the data, to transform it in dataframe format
4. generalize the transformations we performed for one file to all the files.
5. perform exploratory data analysis on the entire dataset
6. summarize our findings
